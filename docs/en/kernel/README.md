# Overview

## Huawei LiteOS Kernel framework

Huawei LiteOS is a lightweight real-time operating system.

<img :src="$withBase('/basic-arch.png')" alt="基本框图">

Basic kernel of Huawei LiteOS is the most tidy code of operating system. It contains operating system components based task management, memory management, time management, communication mechanism, interrupt management, queue management, event management, timer, etc. It can run independently.

## Highlights of Huawei LiteOS Kernel

- Highlight real-time and stable

- Ultra-small kernel, basic kernel size of less than 10 KB

- Low power consumption

- Capable of Static function compaction

## Huawei LiteOS Kernel Modules

### Task

Creates, deletes, delays, suspends, and resumes tasks, and can lock or unlock task scheduling. High priority tasks preempt resources from low priority ones. 

Tasks of the same priority share resources in a round robin setup using time slicing.

### Task Synchronization

- **Semaphore**: creates, deletes, pends on, and releases semaphores.
- **Mutex**: creates, deletes, pends on, and releases mutexes.  

### Hardware Related Functions

Provides the following functions:

- **Interrupt**: Creates, deletes, enables, and disables interrupts; clears interrupt request flags.
- **Timer**: Creates, deletes, starts, and stops timers.

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Provides the following functions:

- **Event**: Reads and writes events   
- **Message queue**: Creates, deletes, reads from, and writes into message queues

### Time Management

- **System time**: generated when an output pulse of a timer/counter triggers an interrupt.
- **Tick time**: the basic time unit used in OS scheduling. The tick length is user configurable. Typically, it is determined by the system clock speed and represented in the form of ticks per second.
- **Software timer**: The timer length is measured in ticks. The Timer_Callback function (a function used to process timer expiry) is called when a soft tick interrupt is generated.

### Memory Management

- Provide two algorithms of dynamic memory and static memory. Allocates or frees memory statically using the Membox algorithm or dynamically using the SLAB algorithm and DLINK algorithm.
- Provides memory statistics, cross-border detection memory.

## Constraints

- Both Huawei LiteOS interfaces and CMSIS interfaces are supported, but hybrid use of them may lead to unpredictable results. (For example, a CMSIS interface is used for requesting semaphores while a Huawei LiteOS interface is used for releasing semaphores.)
- Use only Huawei LiteOS interfaces for driver development. CMSIS interfaces are recommended for app development.
