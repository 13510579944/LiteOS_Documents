# 步骤1：安装传感器，调试器等外设，对 NB-IoT 开发板进行自检

This is a Figure 0 1 of Terabits NB-IoT Evaluation Kits, which contains the following components:
1)	ST-Link v2 in-circuit debugger/programmer x 1
2)	Quectel BC95 NB-IoT communication board x 1
3)	OLED x 1
4)	Temperature & Humidity sensor x 1
5)	Photosensitive sensor x 1
6)	MCU main Board x 1

The main board is developed by STM32F103VCT6 MCU with its high performance. The core is ARM 32-bit CortexTM -M3 CPU with main frequency of up to 72MHz, 256KB Flash, 80 high-speed IO port and rich communication interface, the chip size is only 16x16 mm.

::: warning
When installing the NB-IoT SIM card, it needs to carefully watch the letters, and ensure that the SIM card is installed in place. 
There usually two types of installation: 1) Buckle; 2) Pop
