# 概述

钛比科技 NB-IoT 开发板

Only using 10 steps, you'll learn how to create a NB-IoT end-to-end application which includes both hardware porotype with NB-IoT development board and web application with Node.js by yourself.
After the completion of the tutorial, you can implement such a series of function:
When you push down the button, lighting the alert LED, the button’s state (ON or OFF) will send to center fire alarm station through NB-IoT network. In scenario, we simulate to develop fire button and center station web server.

We will help you to harness the Huawei’s NB-IoT solution development from embedded device to web apps development while avoiding pitfalls. 
Please fasten your seat belt, we will be about to fly into the NB-IoT’s world.

# 您能学到什么

- Based on the Terabits’s NB-IoT development board (you can select another similar board), we will design a simple OneButton embedded application using with a series of development tools, like as STM32CubeMX, SW4STM32, NB-IoT Serials Tools, etc.
- Quick understanding and mastering the development of Huawei OceanConnect IoT platform, including on-line design and develop a OneButton model profile and codec plug-ins on Huawei IoT Developer Portal.
- At last, we could create a simple web server using Node.js/Express and learn how to read “Huawei IoT Platform API Reference(North)”, moreover create your Backend API Gateway.
